# Coding Temple - Module 2 (Bootstrap)

## Description
This is the knowledge check for module 2 (Bootstrap Basics, Utilities, Forms, and Components). We were asked to create a basic, responsive website, with various elements, using Bootstrap 5. I found this very interesting. I was able to make this whole entire page in a third of the time that it took me to make a home page for my Event Center website in the previous module.

Nothing too special here in the description. I just used basic bootstrap code like I was supposed to. I used to bootstrap 5 website to help me find various snipetts to help with styling.
